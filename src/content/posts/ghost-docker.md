Since I have had this blog up and running, I've been using ghost with a [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) virtual machine. If you're looking to go that route, I have written a quick tutorial on that [here](http://mycodingblog.com/up-and-running-with-ghost-and-digital-ocean/). I have not had any issues, but since I have been using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) more and more, I decided it was finally time to throw my blog into a container. I have to admit, it took a few days and a bit of research. Maybe I'm still new at this whole coding thing, I know I have a ton to learn, but seriously?

I ran into a few hiccups, but I did finally find a solution. I am using the [Official Docker Ghost Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/ghost/). It briefly describes how to get it up and running. Well, almost... The commands given will end up giving you an error:

Check that the content path exists and file system permissions are correct.

Reading the comments didn't help me much, but did get me pointed in the right direction. It appears that ghost has permission issues when running in production. However, [@snnd](https://github.com/snnd) posted this little [gem](https://github.com/snnd/docker-ghost-bundle).

So I did what he said and it didn't work. I had to make some more changes to the <code class="bash">start.sh</code> file. In all fairness, it is most likely my fault, but I was able to get it to work.

## Let's Make a Ghost Container!

Be sure to copy your <code class="bash">content</code> folder if you already have a ghost blog up and running. If you don't, you can add these [folders](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/tree/master/content) or use the ones from the [repo](https://github.com/snnd/docker-ghost-bundle) mentioned earlier and place them where ever you want your ghost files to live on your host. You will also need a config file. I did a <code class="language-git">git clone https://github.com/snnd/docker-ghost-bundle.git</code> and changed the directory name to <code class="bash">mycodingblog/</code>.

I also added all of my data, images and theme files to the appropriate directories. Next, I edited the <code class="bash">mycodingblog/config/config.js</code> file:

```javascript
var path = require('path'),
	config

config = {
	production: {
		url: 'http://mycodingblog.com/',
		mail: {},
		database: {
			client: 'sqlite3',
			connection: {
				filename: path.join('/usr/src/ghost/content/data/ghost.db')
			},
			debug: true
		},

		server: {
			host: '0.0.0.0',
			port: '2368'
		}
	}
}

module.exports = config
```

Then I edited the <code class="bash">start.sh</code> file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

docker run -d --name mycodingblog \
	-p 8080:2368 \
	-e VIRTUAL_HOST=mycodingblog.com \
	-e NODE_ENV=production \
	-v /mycodingblog/content/themes:/usr/src/ghost/content/themes \
	-v /mycodingblog/content/apps:/usr/src/ghost/content/apps \
	-v /mycodingblog/content/images:/usr/src/ghost/content/images \
	-v /mycodingblog/content/data:/usr/src/ghost/content/data \
	-v /mycodingblog/config:/var/lib/ghost \
	ghost
```

Then I typed <code class="bash">./start.sh</code>. Of course this was after playing around with it for a few hours. Make sure to use the <code class="bash">-d</code> flag to run in detached mode. It started up and told me to point my browser to <code class="bash">http://mycodingblog.com</code>. So now you should have a ghost container up and running.
