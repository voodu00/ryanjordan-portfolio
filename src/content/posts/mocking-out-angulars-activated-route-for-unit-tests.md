I've been writing a ton of unit tests and snapshot tests lately. While doing so, I have had to mock out a few things. This includes the `ActivatedRoute`. So let's say we have the following component.

<!--more-->

```typescript
@Component({
	selector: 'app-test',
	templateUrl: './test.component.html',
	styleUrls: ['./test.component.scss']
})
export class TestComponent implements OnInit {
	importantData: any

	constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {}

	ngOnInit(): void {
		this.importantData = this.route.snapshot.data['importantData']
	}
}
```

In order to mock the data out, you will need to use your mocked router object. So your test should look something like:

```typescript
import { TestBed, async, ComponentFixture } from '@angular/core/testing'
import { TestComponent } from './test.component'
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router'

describe('TestComponent', () => {
	let component: TestComponent
	let fixture: ComponentFixture<TestComponent>
	const activatedRouteMock = {
		snapshot: {
			data: {
				importantData: {
					content: 'Really Important String'
				}
			}
		}
	}

	beforeEach(async(() => {
		TestBed.configureTestingModule({
			declarations: [TestComponent],
			providers: [{ provide: ActivatedRoute, useValue: activatedRouteMock }]
		})
			.compileComponents()
			.then(() => {
				fixture = TestBed.createComponent(TestComponent)
				component = fixture.componentInstance
			})
	}))

	it('should be defined', () => {
		expect(component).toBeDefined()
	})

	it('should render the component', () => {
		fixture.detectChanges()
		expect(fixture).toMatchSnapshot()
	})
})
```

We can take this a step further and mock out queryParams as well. In our `OnInit` method we would have something like:

```typescript
this.route.queryParams.subscribe((params) => {
	this.moreImportantData.firstEntry = params['firstEntry']
	this.moreImportantData.secondEntry = params['secondEntry']
})
```

In order to set the params we would simply mock it out like so:

```typescript
const activatedRouteMock = {
	queryParams: of({
		firstEntry: 'This is the first entry',
		secondEntry: 'This is the second entry'
	})
}
```

Mocking out the `ActivatedRoute` is fairly straightforward. But just like every skill you learn, if you haven't written any tests in a while or mocked it out, a quick reference like this is very helpful!
